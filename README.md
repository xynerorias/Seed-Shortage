# Seed-Shortage


<h2>| NOT YET FINISHED DO NOT DOWNLOAD |</h2>
<br/>

A mod for Stardew Valley that removes the seeds from the shops. Instead, players should clean up the farm, go out in the forest and the mines in order to find some new varieties.<br/>

It has a Content Pack that replaces the recipe of the Seed Maker to be available in the beginning. Ir requires some copper ore so the player should explore the mine when it's open to. By that time, the first parsnip seeds should be grown and can be used to make some other seeds.<br/>

**Requires the Better Mixed Seeds mod.**<br/>

The mod also has an optional config file that changes the seed drop rate. It is highly recommended to use it for a balanced playthrough. It aims to add some RNG to the game, and make some seeds rare than others. It takes into account the original seed price, the vendor, the seasonal profit of each seeds, and the original seed purchase requirement (being in the second eyar for example).<br/>
If this is used, it is recommended to not touch the configs of Seed Shortage otherwise some seeds won't be available (e.g: Coffee Bean).

**There are two versions available. Only choose one.**

<h3>JA version:</h3>

Requires Json Assets (and by extension, SpaceCore). Compatible with all seed mods but only synergizes with the PPJA suite and Farmer to Florist.

The two main goals was to:

  -Add a slight challenge to the game, prevent snowballing in terms of money, and improve the game's longevity.
  -Declutter the seed-shop vendors as they become unbearably full when you start to add some custom crops.
  
The mod removes the seeds entirely but only from the shops. That means any mod adding seeds will have them removed in the usual shops but also that custom shops are not restricted by this. You can have a custom shop using Shop Tile Framework selling seeds while the rest of the vanilla shops don't have them. 

A good example for that is the very thing that made me start this mod: the Seed Catalogue mod. Using this, you can buy seeds but only from crops you have already shipped. So it makes an interesting game of "catch them all" if you are using multiple new crops-adding mods.

While it removes seeds from shops, it adds some configurability. Using [Mousey's PPJA repository](https://mouseypounds.github.io/ppja-ref/crops.html), I added some exceptions to some seeds I thought would make sense. See the Nexus page for reasoning and config explanations.

The mods it synergizes with are:
  - Fruits and Veggies for Json Assets
  - More Trees
  - Mizu's Flowers
  - Fresh Meat - An Alternative Butcher Mod
  - Fantasy Crops
  - Farmer to Florist
  
As said previously, while these are the mods it synergizes with, Seed Shortage is still compatible with other seed-adding mods. For more information on mods compatibility, see the Nexus page. The content pack replacing some dialogues and strings has also some synergies but those mods are not required.


<h3>Vanilla Version</h3>

Is doesn't require additional mods like Json Assets or other crop mods. Just [SMAPI](smapi.io), Content Patcher to replace the seed maker recipe, some dialogues and other things of the sort, and Better Mixed Seeds to be able to aquire the seeds.<br/>

It's basically the same thing as the JA version but without any modded crops support, and no mod synergy. The content pack only edits the vanilla dialogues, strings, mails etc...<br/>
The mod itself only touches the crops present in the vanilla game and therefore is much lighter.<br/>

This is meant for people who do not use any custom crops, and people who do not have a heavy mod list, who want to stay close to the vanilla game but still have the added challenge. It still requires Better Mixed Seeds to get the seeds.
